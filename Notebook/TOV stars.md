## TOV stars

TOV stands for "Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff". It is a solution of General Relativity and Euler's equations for hydrostatic equilibrium, describing an asymptotically flat spacetime containing a spherically symmetric and static star.

Since the star is spherically symmetric, the exterior of the star is described by the Schwarzschild solution.

The equations of motion and the continuity equation must hold:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\nabla_{\mu} T^{\mu \nu}=0 \\
\nabla_{\mu} j^{\mu}=0
\end{array}
$$
with $j^{\mu}=\rho u^{\mu}$. An additional relation has to be given by an EOS, e.g., the polytropic EOS to close this system.
