## Effective One Body (EOB)

- Motivated by the construction of LIGO and Virgo detectors, an analytical approach that combines the PN expansion and perturbation theory, known as the effective-one-body (EOB) approach, was introduced.

For a binary system with component masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, the EOB conservative dynamics for the binary can be described by the Hamiltonian

$$
H_{\mathrm{EOB}}=M \sqrt{1+2 \nu\left(\frac{H_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\mu}-1\right)}
$$

where $\mu=m_{1} m_{2} / M$ is the reduced mass, $\nu=\mu / M$ is the symmetric mass ratio and $M=m_{1}+m_{2}$ is the total mass.

In the EOB framework, the spin-aligned orbital evolution is described by orbit phase $\phi$, radial distance $r$, and the corresponding canonical momentums $p_{\phi}$ and $p_{r}$. The other four parameters $\left(K, d_{\mathrm{SO}}, d_{\mathrm{SS}}, \delta_{\text {peak}}^{22}\right)$ can be determined through calibration against numerical relativity simulations.

The gravitational waves would take away energy and angular momentum. Such effect can be described by the radiation-reaction force.
