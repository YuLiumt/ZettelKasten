## Supermassive black hole binaries

Supermassive black hole binaries are a natural consequence of galaxy mergers, since massive galaxies are known to host [[Supermassive Black Hole]]. In the post-merger galaxy, the SMBHs evolve through dynamical friction and stellar interactions, and eventually form a gravitationally bound binary. At small (milli-parsec) separations, the binary evolution is dominated by the emission of [[Gravitational Wave]].
