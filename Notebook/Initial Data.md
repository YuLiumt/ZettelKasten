## Initial Data

## Spin

The two neutron stars cannot be tidal locked, because the viscosity of neutron star matter is too low. This means that initial data sequences of corotating configurations for different separations cannot be used to approximate the inspiral of two neutron stars. On the other hand, sequences of irrotational configurations can be used to approximate the inspiral of two neutron stars without spin. 

A typical neutron star has a mass of about $1.4 M_{\odot}$ and a radius on the order of $15 \mathrm{km}$. From Keplerâ€™s law the orbital period

$$
    P_{o} \sim 6 \mathrm{ms} \left(\frac{d}{50 \mathrm{km}}\right)^{3 / 2}\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{-1 / 2} 
$$
is on the order of a few milliseconds during the last orbit before merger where the separation $d \sim 50 \mathrm{km}$ Thus systems with spin periods that are much larger than $P_{o}$ should be treatable as approximately irrotational, while systems with spin periods of a few milliseconds (such as millisecond pulsars) cannot be regarded as irrotational. This fact explains why irrotational initial data are far more popular today.
