## 3+1 Formalism

One way to do numerical simulations using full General Relativity is to split the four components of the spacetime into three "space" and one "time" coordinate. Therefore it is called the "3+1" formalism.

## Initial Value Problem

In Newtonian mechanics, the trajectory of a point particle is fixed by its initial position, initial velocity and the forces acting on it.

In order to "translate" this into General Relativity we need to specify the "initial state", because in General Relativity there is no notion of absolute simultaneity. An observer can define a notion of simultaneity, but this depends upon his state of motion. Thus, choosing an initial state requires choosing an initial hypersurface.
