## BBH - Orbital Precession

When either black hole carries spin that is not aligned with the orbital angular momentum, there is an exchange of angular momentum between the components of the system, leading to complicated dynamical behavior.



Recently, the SXS collaboration has published numerical-relativity solutions to the full Einstein equations for precessing BBH systems.
