## BBH - Orbital Precession

When either black hole carries spin that is not aligned with the orbital angular momentum, there is an exchange of angular momentum between the components of the system, leading to complicated dynamical behavior.

Both the precession of the spins and of the orbital plane each introduce modulations into the GW amplitude, oscillations into the GW frequency, and variations in the distribution of signal power across different harmonics of the waveform.

For example, the total phase of the dominant mode of the signal depends on the initial orientation of the orbital plane.

Recently, the SXS collaboration has published numerical-relativity solutions to the full Einstein equations for precessing BBH systems.
