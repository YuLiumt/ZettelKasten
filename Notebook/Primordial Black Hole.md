## Primordial Black Hole

Theories considering PBHs as [[Dark Matter]] candidate have gained significant interest recently after the observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration because of the possibility that the observed black holes of supersolar mass can be of primordial origin.

## Mass

Due to Hawking radiation, PBHs evaporate on a timescale $t_{\mathrm{ev}}=5120 \pi G^{2} M^{3} /\left(\hbar c^{4}\right)$, so that PBHs of mass lower than $M \simeq 5 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~g}$ or $2.5 \times 10^{-19} M_{\odot}$ have completely evaporated by now.

Slightly heavier PBHs have lower temperature, however, they have not completely evaporated yet and may radiate gamma-ray photons and neutrinos.
