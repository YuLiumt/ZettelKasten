## Compact Star

In astronomy, a compact star is a star that is a [[White Dwarf|white dwarf]], a [[Neutron Stars|neutron star]] or a [[Black Hole|black hole]].

Compact stars form the endpoint of stellar evolution. A star shines and thus loses its nuclear energy reservoir in a finite time. When a star has exhausted all its energy (which is called a stellar death), the gas pressure of the hot interior can no longer support the weight of the star and the star collapses to a denser state - a compact star.

Compact objects such as white dwarfs and neutron stars have extremely high densities that cannot be created in terrestrial laboratories and involve phases of matter that are not yet well understood.
