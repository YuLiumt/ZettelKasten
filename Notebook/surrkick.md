## surrkick

Our procedure uses a numerical-relativity surrogate model to obtain the gravitational waveform given a set of binary parameters, then from this waveform we directly integrate the gravitational-wave linear momentum flux.

The SXS surrogate model NRSur7dq2 and a few other dependencies will be installed together with surrkick.
