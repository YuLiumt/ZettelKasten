## NR - Gauge conditions

The lapse function $\alpha$ and the shift vector $\beta^{a}$ can be chosen freely. The most trivial setting is

$$
\alpha=1, \quad \beta^{a}=0
$$
which simplifies the equations a lot. However, numerically, such a gauge is not the best choice for many cases. One reason can be that one wants to avoid a (forming) singularity.
