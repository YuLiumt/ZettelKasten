## Metric

The metric tensor of four-dimensional spacetime is denoted by $g_{a b}$ and determines the invariant interval (distance) between two nearby events in spacetime according to

$$
d s^{2}=g_{a b} d x^{a} d x^{b} \tag{1}
$$
Here $d x^{a}$ are the differences in the coordinates $x^{a}$ that label events, or points, in spacetime. For a flat spacetime, $g_{a b}$ becomes the Minkowski metric $\eta_{a b}$. In Cartesian coordinates with $x^{0}=t$, $x^{1}=x$, $x^{2}=y$ and $x^{3}=z$, the Minkowski metric components are

$$
\eta_{a b}=\operatorname{diag}(-1,1,1,1) \tag{2}
$$
representing a global inertial or Lorentz frame. 

> The Lorentz transformations imply that the interval $d s^{2}$ has the same value as measured by any observer. This is a direct consequence of the postulate of the invariance of the speed of light. 

From the metric one can distinguish events related to each other in three different ways:

$$
\begin{aligned} d s^{2} &>0 & & \text { spacelike separation, } \\ d s^{2} &<0 & & \text { timelike separation, } \\ d s^{2} &=0 & &\text { null separation. } \end{aligned} \tag{3}
$$
All material objects move following timelike trajectories, and light moves along null trajectories.

In general, the components of the metric tensor are given by the scalar dot products between the four basis vectors $\mathbf{e}_{a}$ that span the vector space tangent to the spacetime manifold,

$$
g_{a b}=\mathbf{e}_{a} \cdot \mathbf{e}_{b} \tag{4}
$$
In a coordinate basis, the basis vectors are tangent vectors to coordinate lines and may be written as $\mathbf{e}_{a}=\partial / \partial x^{a} \equiv \partial_{a}$. Clearly coordinate basis vectors commute. It is sometimes useful to set up orthonormal basis vectors at a point (an orthonormal tetrad) for which

$$
\mathbf{e}_{\hat{a}} \cdot \mathbf{e}_{\hat{b}}=\eta_{\hat{a} \hat{b}} \tag{5}
$$
We denote an orthonormal tetrad by carets. In general, orthonormal basis vectors do not form a coordinate basis and do not commute. However, in flat spacetime it is always possible to transform to coordinates which are everywhere orthonormal or globally inertial, whereby the metric is given by equation (2) everywhere. For a general spacetime, this is not possible. But we can always choose any particular event in spacetime to be the origin of a local inertial coordinate frame, where $g_{a b}=\eta_{a b}$ at that point and where, in addition, the first derivatives of the metric tensor at that point vanish, i.e., $\partial_{a} g_{b c}=0$. An observer in such a coordinate frame is called a local inertial or local Lorentz observer and can use a coordinate basis that forms a local orthonornal tetrad to make measurements as in special relativity. In fact, such an observer will find that all the (nongravitational) laws of physics in this frame are the same as in special relativity (Principle of Equivalence).
