## Matched Filtering

Matched filtering compares two signals, $s_{1}(t)$ and $s_{2}(t)$. It does this by Fourier transforming each into the frequency domain, taking the product of the signals, weighting each inversely by the noise—which is a function of frequency—and integrating over all frequencies.
