## Neutron Stars

Neutron stars (NSs) are extremely compact stars, born in supernova explosions at the end of a massive star's life. They have a typical mass of $\sim 1.4 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and a typical radius of $\sim 10 \mathrm{~km}$; the resulting compactness $M / R$ is then $\sim 10^{5}$ times higher than the Sun and makes them the most compact objects in our Universe.

NSs are very interesting as they represent natural "laboratories" to test Physics under extreme conditions, impossible to reproduce on Earth.

A second major element of fundamental Physics justifying the growing interest for NSs is the emission of gravitational waves.

Neutron Stars are a degenerate state of matter that is formed after the core collapse in a supernova event (where the electrons fall into nuclear matter and get captured by protons forming neutrons).

Excellent laboratory to study high-density nuclear physics and EOS.
