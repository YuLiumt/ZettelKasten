# McLachlan Thorn

The spacetime is evolved with the McLachlan code, which is part of the Einstein Toolkit.

- As gauge conditions, we use the $1 + log$-slicing condition for the lapse function and the hyperbolic $\Gamma$-driver condition for the shift vector.
- At the outer boundary, we use the Sommerfeld radiation boundary condition.

- [[BSSN]]
	- the most widely used formulation of the Einstein equations
- [[CCZ4]]
	- with a constraint-damping scheme
