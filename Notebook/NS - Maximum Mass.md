## NS - Maximum Mass

One of the most important characteristics of a neutron star is its maximum allowed mass. The maximum mass is crucial for distinguishing between neutron stars and black holes in compact binaries and for determining the outcome of many astrophysical processes, including supernova collapse and the merger of Binary Neutron Star.

## Rotation

Rotation can further increase the maximum allowed mass.

## Relationship Graph

- The maximum mass of a cold, nonrotating, spherical neutron star is uniquely determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and depends only on the cold [[Equation of State]].
- For most recent equations of state, this maximum mass is in the range of $1.8-2.3 M_{\odot}$, significantly smaller than the mass expected for the remnant of a binary neutron star merger. [[BNS - Merger Fate]]
