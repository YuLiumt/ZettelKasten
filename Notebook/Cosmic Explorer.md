## Cosmic Explorer

Cosmic Explorer has a two-stage design. The first stage of Cosmic Explorer (CE1) assumes that the detector’s core technologies will be similar to those of Advanced LIGO with the sensitivity gain from increasing the detector’s arm length from 4 km to 40 km. The second stage (CE2) is a technology upgrade to the CE1 detector that further increases Cosmic Explorer’s sensitivity.

Advanced LIGO’s most sensitive frequency lies around 40 Hz with almost no detectable signal below 10 Hz. For CE1 and CE2, the peak sensitivity of the detectors to binary neutron stars is shifted to lower frequencies, with a non-trivial amount of signal-to-noise available below 10 Hz.
