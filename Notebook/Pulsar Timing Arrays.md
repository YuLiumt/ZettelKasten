## Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA)

Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) measure precisely the times of arrival (TOAs) of pulses for a set of very stable millisecond pulsars. [[Millisecond Pulsar]]

GWs passing through the Milky Way distort the Earth-pulsar distance, and induce coherent deviations in the TOAs. If such deviations are measured over multiple pulsars in the array with a characteristic quadrupole correlation signature, then GWs can be detected. [[Gravitational Wave]]


## Source

The [[Supermassive black hole binaries|most massive binaries]] ($10^{8}-10^{10} M_{\odot}$) are strong sources of GWs in the nanohertz band ($\sim 1-100 \mathrm{nHz}$) and are promising targets for PTAs.
