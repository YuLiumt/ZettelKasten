## Dark Matter

So far, we have only been able to observe its gravitational influence on the visible sector of the Universe.

## Theories

Myriads of theories have been proposed to explain DM.

- Weakly interactive massive particle
- axion and axion-like particle
- [[Primordial Black Hole]]
- and so on

However, we have not yet seen any compelling experimental or observational signature of any of these theories, and it still remains to be one of the most active fields of research.
