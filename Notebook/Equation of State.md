## Equation of State

The equation of state (EOS) describes the connection between various properties of matter such as the temperature $T$, the mass density $\rho$, the internal energy $\epsilon$, the composition and the pressure $P$.

The EOS of neutron stars is not well known, because the expected densities and temperatures are well above anything which could be achieved in any experimental setup today.

A general EOS for a one-component fluid has the form

$$
P=P(\rho, \epsilon)
$$
where $\rho$ is the rest-mass density, $\epsilon$ the specific energy density and $P$ the pressure.


The true EOS for nuclear matter in an environment similar to a neutron star is still not known, not even assuming a small effect of the temperature, i.e., a cold neutron star.

- The analysis of tidal effects in the late inspiral of BNS systems is very important, because it brings a signature of the neutron stars EOS, which influences the stars tidal deformability. [[BNS - Tidal Deformability]]

## Type

- [[APR4 EOS]] obtained using variational chain summation methods with the Argonne two-nucleon interaction and including also boost corrections and three-nucleon interactions.
- [[SLy EOS]] based on the Skyrme Lyon effective nuclear interaction.
- [[H4 EOS]] constructed in a relativistic mean field framework including also Hyperons contributions and tuning the parameters to have the stiffest possible EOS compatible with astrophysical data.
- [[MS1 EOS]] constructed with relativistic mean field theory considering only standard nuclear matter.
