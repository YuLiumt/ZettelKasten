# Equation of State

The true EOS for nuclear matter in an environment similar to a neutron star is still not known, not even assuming a small effect of the temperature, i.e., a cold neutron star.

We thus have to simulate the effect of different plausible EOSs on observable quantities, in the hope to learn about the EOS indirectly through these observations.

- [[APR4 EOS]] obtained using variational chain summation methods with the Argonne two-nucleon interaction and including also boost corrections and three-nucleon interactions.
- [[SLy EOS]] based on the Skyrme Lyon effective nuclear interaction.
- [[H4 EOS]] constructed in a relativistic mean field framework including also Hyperons contributions and tuning the parameters to have the stiffest possible EOS compatible with astrophysical data.
- [[MS1 EOS]] constructed with relativistic mean field theory considering only standard nuclear matter.

During the evolution, the EOS is supplemented by a thermal component of the form

$$
P_{\mathrm{th}}=\Gamma_{\mathrm{th}} \rho\left(\epsilon-\epsilon_{\mathrm{cold}}\right)
$$
choosing $\Gamma_{\mathrm{th}}=1.8$.

- The analysis of tidal effects in the late inspiral of BNS systems is very important, because it brings a signature of the neutron stars EOS, which influences the stars tidal deformability. [[Binary Neutron Star#Tidal Deformability]]
