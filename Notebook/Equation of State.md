# Equation of State

The true EOS for nuclear matter in an environment similar to a neutron star is still not known, not even assuming a small effect of the temperature, i.e., a cold neutron star.

- [[EOS - Hybrid]]
	- [[Piecewise-Polytropic EOS]]

- The analysis of tidal effects in the late inspiral of BNS systems is very important, because it brings a signature of the neutron stars EOS, which influences the stars tidal deformability. [[BNS - Tidal Deformability]]
