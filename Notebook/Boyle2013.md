## Angular velocity of gravitational radiation from precessing binaries and the corotating frame

- **Author**:  [[Michael Boyle]].
- **Summary**:
	- Developing a frame in which all rotational behavior is eliminated, simplifying the waveform as much as possible
	- GWFrames
		- The core functions are written in C++ for speed, using several functions from the GNU Scientific Library.
