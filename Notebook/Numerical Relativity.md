# Numerical Relativity

Tags: #important

For all but the simplest systems, analytic solutions for the evolution of such systems do not exist. Hence the task of solving [[Einstein's equations]] must be performed numerically on a computer.

- One of the most significant goals of numerical relativity is to compute accurate gravitational waveforms. [[Waveform Templates]]

## History

- A major step forward occurred 2005, when three independent groups developed two different techniques, the generalised harmonic [[Gauge]] formalism and the socalled [[Moving Puncture]] method, to evolve vacuum spacetimes containing [[Black Hole]] without encountering numerical instabilities that mark the end of a numerical simulation.
