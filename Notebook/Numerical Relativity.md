## Numerical Relativity

For all but the simplest systems, analytic solutions for the evolution of such systems do not exist. Hence the task of solving Einstein's equations must be performed numerically on a computer.

## Equations

- Einstein Equations
	$$
  R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu} R=8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}
  $$
- Conservation of energy momentum
	$$
  \nabla_{\mu} T^{\mu \nu}=0
  $$
- Conservation of baryon density
	$$
  \nabla_{\mu}\left(\rho u^{\mu}\right)=0
  $$
- Equation of state
	$$
  p=p(\rho, \epsilon)
  $$

## History

- A major step forward occurred 2005, when three independent groups developed two different techniques, the generalised harmonic [[Gauge]] formalism and the socalled [[Moving Puncture]] method, to evolve vacuum spacetimes containing [[Black Hole]] without encountering numerical instabilities that mark the end of a numerical simulation.

## Source

* [[Binary Neutron Star]]
* [[Binary Black Hole]]
	* Because LIGO is only sensitive to the last few orbits of stellar-mass BHB mergers, and because of the large computational resources needed to produce these simulations, BHB simulations start at relatively small initial separations in astrophysical terms.
	* On the other hand, by the time a BHB enters the LIGO sensitivity band we expect that the eccentricity will be very small because any eccentricity of astrophysical origin would have been most likely radiated away well before the late-inspiral.
