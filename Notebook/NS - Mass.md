## NS - Mass

The most accurate measures of NS masses available come from timing observations of pulsars in binary systems, both with a main-sequence or a compact companion star (i.e. a white dwarf or a second NS). In some cases the masses are determined with impressive accuracy (one example is the Hulse-Taylor binary PSR 1913+16).

A second possibility is to infer the mass of an accreting NS in X-ray binaries, but with less accurate results.

## Maximum Mass

For each EOS employed to model the NS interior we have a value for its maximum mass, the NS analogous of the Chandrasekhar mass limit for white dwarfs. Therefore, the mass measurement alone can rule out all the EOS with a mass limit lower than the highest value observed.

One of the most important characteristics of a neutron star is its maximum allowed mass. The maximum mass is crucial for distinguishing between neutron stars and black holes in compact binaries and for determining the outcome of many astrophysical processes, including supernova collapse and the merger of Binary Neutron Star.

Rotation can further increase the maximum allowed mass.

## Relationship Graph

- The maximum mass of a cold, nonrotating, spherical neutron star is uniquely determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and depends only on the cold [[Equation of State]].
- For most recent equations of state, this maximum mass is in the range of $1.8-2.3 M_{\odot}$, significantly smaller than the mass expected for the remnant of a binary neutron star merger. [[BNS - Merger Fate]]
