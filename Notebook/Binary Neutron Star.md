##  Binary Neutron Star

- Binary neutron star are one of the most promising sources for the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors and also a high-energy astrophysical phenomenon as illustrated by the observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic (EM) waves in the event of [[GW170817]].
- Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are valuable laboratories for nuclear astrophysics.
- An accurate modeling of neutron star mergers requires [[Numerical Relativity]].
