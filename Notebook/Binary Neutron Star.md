##  Binary Neutron Star

- Binary neutron star are one of the most promising sources for the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors and also a high-energy astrophysical phenomenon as illustrated by the observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic (EM) waves in the event of [[GW170817]].
- Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are valuable laboratories for nuclear astrophysics.
- An accurate modeling of neutron star mergers requires [[Numerical Relativity]].

## Merger stages

- [[BNS - Inspiral phase]]
	- [[BNS - Orbit Eccentricity]]
	- [[BNS - Merger TIme]]
	- [[BNS - Tidal Deformability]]
	- [[BNS - Dynamical ejecta]]
- [[BNS - Merger Phase]]
	- [[BNS - Magnetic field amplification]]
	- [[BNS - Instabilities mode ]]
	- [[BNS - Postmerger Spectrum]]
	- [[BNS - Neutrino-driven winds]]
	- [[BNS - Magnetic-driven winds]]
	- [[BNS - Merger Fate]]

## Multimessenger

Besides emitting gravitational waves, binary neutron stars can emit also a wide range of electromagnetic signals and even neutrino signals. Different signals can be used to extract different and complementary information, to help reconstructing a picture of the source physics.
