#  Binary Neutron Star

- Binary neutron star are one of the most promising sources for the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors and also a high-energy astrophysical phenomenon as illustrated by the observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic (EM) waves in the event of [[GW170817]].
- Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are valuable laboratories for nuclear astrophysics.
- An accurate modeling of neutron star mergers requires [[Numerical Relativity]].

##  Inspiral phase

The two stars rotate rapidly one around the other, and their distance shrinks due to the energy and angular momentum radiated away by [[Gravitational Wave]].

In the last few milliseconds before merger, the tidal deformation of each star due to the gravitational field of the companion become important, speeding up the GW phase evolution. 

It is important to know how many orbits before merger can be effectively simulated using current numerical methods and resolutions. [[Maione2016]]

### Merger TIme

- Binary starting with zero radial velocity. For this reason, merger time results must be taken with care. [[Maione2016]]

### Tidal Deformability

During the inspiral phase (before contact), BNS systems differ from the BBH ones by the presence of tidal interactions which affect both the dynamics of the inspiral and the emitted waveform.

- The tidal deformability of neutron stars has been proposed as one of the most promising quantities related to the [[Equation of State]] that can be extracted from the [[Gravitational Wave]] observation.

## Merger Phase

The two stars come finally into contact, compressing their matter and giving rise to a complex hydrodynamical phenomenology, with instabilities and turbulence active inside the merger remnant, like the [[Kelvin-Helmotz instability]], which can strongly amplify the stars [[Magnetic Field]].

### Magnetic field amplification

Magnetic field amplification in BNS mergers happens mainly due to the Kelvin-Helmotz (KH) instability during the merger phase. The KH instability creates vortices in the shear layer after the two neutron stars come into contact, that amplify the [[Magnetic Field]], converting kinetic energy into turbulent energy and stretching the magnetic filed lines, producing a magnetic field exponential growth.

### Instabilities mode

The detection of gravitational waves by neutron stars instabilities or oscillation modes will open the field of gravitational wave asterosysmology, which means studying the internal structure of neutron stars thanks to the GW coming from their oscillation, like the internal structure of Earth can be studied looking at earthquakes.

- The gravitational-radiation driven [[Bar Mode]] instability occurs if the star is rapidly rotating.


### Collapse Time

Observations of binary pulsars suggest that the individual stars in such systems have masses very close to $1.4 M_{\odot}$. If mass loss during the final binary coalescence can be neglected, the remnant of such a merger will then have a rest mass exceeding $3 M_{\odot}$. If this mass is larger than the maximum allowed mass for [[Neutron Star]], then the merger will lead to prompt collapse to a black hole on a dynamical (millisecond) timescale. If, however, neutron stars can support such a high mass, at least temporarily, then the merger may result in a high-mass, quasi-equilibrium neutron star, which only later may collapse to a black hole. The two different outcomes may have important consequences for [[Gravitational Wave]] signals and, possibly, [[Gamma-ray burst]] models.

### Postmerger Spectrum

The postmerger spectrum exhibits several distinct peaks in the kHz range, which are connected to certain oscillation modes and dynamical features of the postmerger remnant. Understanding the physical mechanisms generating these different features is essential for the detection and interpretation of postmerger GW signals.

## Ejecta

### Shock-heated ejecta

The shock-heated ejecta are less neutron-rich respect to tidal interactions ejecta, because their high temperature (above $1$ MeV) allows electron-positron pairs production, which get captured by protons and neutrons respectively, emitting electronic neutrinos and antineutrinos. Given the much larger abundance of neutrons respect to protons, there are many more positron captures, leaving the matter with a higher electron fraction $Y_{e}$.

### Tidal-driven ejecta

Tidal-driven ejecta are emitted mostly in the orbital plane, and are very neutron-rich. 

Tidal ejecta are dominant in BNS mergers with high mass asymmetries. In that case, the merger is less violent, because the low mass star gets tidally deformed already in the early merger phase, so the shock heating is less strong.
