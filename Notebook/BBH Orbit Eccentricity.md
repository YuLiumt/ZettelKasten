## BBH Orbit Eccentricity

Due to the circularization effect of gravitational radiation, ones may expect that the binary black hole systems are always near circular when they enter the LIGO frequency band. But recent investigations show it is not absolutely true.

- The study of the galactic cluster M22 indicate that about $20\%$ of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in globular clusters will have eccentricities larger than $0.1$ when they first enter advanced LIGO band at 10Hz, and that $\sim 10\%$ may have eccentricities $e \sim 1$.
