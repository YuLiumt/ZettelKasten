## Piecewise-Polytropic EOS

With only four parameters, the piecewise-polytropic EOS can approximate any candidate of the EOS of supernuclear-density matter. By using this EOS, we can systematically study the effects of the possible EOSs on phenomena related to the supernuclear-density matter, such as the merger of binary neutron stars.

- [[APR4 EOS]] obtained using variational chain summation methods with the Argonne two-nucleon interaction and including also boost corrections and three-nucleon interactions.
- [[SLy EOS]] based on the Skyrme Lyon effective nuclear interaction.
- [[H4 EOS]] constructed in a relativistic mean field framework including also Hyperons contributions and tuning the parameters to have the stiffest possible EOS compatible with astrophysical data.
- [[MS1 EOS]] constructed with relativistic mean field theory considering only standard nuclear matter.
