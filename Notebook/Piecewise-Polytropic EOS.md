## Piecewise-Polytropic EOS

With only four parameters, the piecewise-polytropic EOS can approximate any candidate of the EOS of supernuclear-density matter. By using this EOS, we can systematically study the effects of the possible EOSs on phenomena related to the supernuclear-density matter, such as the merger of binary neutron stars.
