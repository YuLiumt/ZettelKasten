## Black Hole-Neutron Star Binaries

- Mergers of black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries are expected to be observed by gravitational wave (GW) detectors in the coming years.


- The main formation pathway leading to BHNS mergers is under debate, but the favored scenario is that they form from two massive stars that are born in a binary and evolve in isolation, typically involving a common envelope (CE) episode that tightens the binary orbit
