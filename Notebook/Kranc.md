Kranc is a Mathematica application which turns a tensorial description of a time dependent partial differential equation into a module for the Cactus Computational Toolkit.


Kranc was originally written by Sascha Husa, Ian Hinder, Christiane Lechner and is now actively developed by Ian Hinder, [[Erik Schnetter]] and Barry Wardell.
