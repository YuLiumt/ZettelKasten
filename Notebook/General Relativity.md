## General Relativity

The theory of general relativity, postulated by Albert Einstein at the end of 1915, is the modern theory of gravitation. According to this theory, gravity is not a force as it used to be considered in Newtonian physics, but rather a manifestation of the "curvature" of space-time. A massive object produces a distortion in the geometry of space-time around it, and in turn this distortion controls (or alters) the movement of physical objects. In the words of John A. Wheeler: **Matter tells space-time how to curve, and space-time tells matter how to move.**
