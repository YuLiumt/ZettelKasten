## General Relativity

The theory of general relativity, postulated by Albert Einstein at the end of 1915, is the modern theory of gravitation. According to this theory, gravity is not a force as it used to be considered in Newtonian physics, but rather a manifestation of the "curvature" of space-time. A massive object produces a distortion in the geometry of space-time around it, and in turn this distortion controls (or alters) the movement of physical objects. In the words of John A. Wheeler: **Matter tells space-time how to curve, and space-time tells matter how to move.**

## Geometrical framework

- [[GR - Metric]]
- [[GR - Vector]]
- [[GR - Dual vector]]
- Tensor
- [[GR - Covariant derivative]]
- [[GR - Lie derivative]]

## Analytic solutions

Although the general formula look very simple, the difficulties are hidden in the form in which they are written down. General Relativity is now known for nearly one century, but only a few analytic solutions with astrophysical relevance are known. Even those are very simple compared to reality. In the following, we will look shortly into some of them.

- [[Minkowski]]
- [[Schwarzschild]]
- [[Kerr]]
