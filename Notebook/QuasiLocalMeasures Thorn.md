The final mass an be computed from the Christodoulou formula in terms of the black hole (BH) angular momentum and AH area $A$ as

$$
M_{f}=\sqrt{M_{i r r}^{2}+\frac{S^{2}}{4 M_{i r r}^{2}}}, \quad M_{i r r}=\sqrt{\frac{A}{16 \pi}}
$$
where $M_{irr}$ is the irreducible mass. The dimensionless final spin can then be computed as $\chi_{f}=S / M_{f}^{2}$.
