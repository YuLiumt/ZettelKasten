## GW190426_152155

GW190426_152155 is the candidate event with the highest false alarm rate ($1.4 ~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) among the LIGO/Virgo events in GWTC-2. 

Assuming it is a signal of astrophysical origin, the LIGO/Virgo collaboration has estimated its component masses to be $5.7_{-2.3}^{+4.0} \mathbf{M}_{\odot}$ and $1.5_{-0.5}^{+0.8} \mathbf{M}_{\odot}$, rendering it the first candidate BH-NS merger. 

GW190426_152155, which was not followed by any EM counterpart.
