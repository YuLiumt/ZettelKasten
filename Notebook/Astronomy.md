## Objects

There is strong evidence that objects like neutron stars or black holes do exist and even collide in our universe. Such a collision is believed to radiate a lot of energy in form the of gravitational waves (ripples in spacetime) which might be detectable by the newly built gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO and Virgo.
