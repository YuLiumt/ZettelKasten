## BNS Inspiral phase

The two stars rotate rapidly one around the other, and their distance shrinks due to the energy and angular momentum radiated away by [[Gravitational Wave]].

In the last few milliseconds before merger, the tidal deformation of each star due to the gravitational field of the companion become important, speeding up the GW phase evolution. 

It is important to know how many orbits before merger can be effectively simulated using current numerical methods and resolutions. [[Maione2016]]
