## BNS - Shock-heated ejecta

The shock-heated ejecta is the result of the shock produced when the two NS cores crush into each other and of further shocks associated with the first, most violent oscillations of the merged object. In this case, the mass outflow is in all directions, although the contribution at large polar angles typically dominates over the contribution along the orbital axis.

- The shock-heated ejecta are less neutron-rich respect to [[BNS - Tidal-driven ejecta]]
	- Because their high temperature (above $1$ MeV) allows electron-positron pairs production, which get captured by protons and neutrons respectively, emitting electronic neutrinos and antineutrinos. Given the much larger abundance of neutrons respect to protons, there are many more positron captures, leaving the matter with a higher electron fraction $Y_{e}$.
