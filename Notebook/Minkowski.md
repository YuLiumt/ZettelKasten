## Minkowski

The Minkowski solution is a trivial solution, neglecting any energy or curvature. Special Relativity is assuming that the spacetime is the Minkowski spacetime and is not influenced by anything happening inside. The line element for the Minkowski metric in Cartesian coordinates is just

$$
\mathrm{d} s^{2}=-\mathrm{d} t^{2}+\mathrm{d} x^{2}+\mathrm{d} y^{2}+\mathrm{d} z^{2}
