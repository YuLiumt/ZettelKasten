## NS - Radius

Measuring the radius of a NS is a much harder task. 

The combined knowledge of a NS mass and radius is of crucial importance as it allows to put a direct constraint on the EOS.

## Measurement methods

- A possible way to infer the NS radius is from the measurement of both X-ray flux and surface temperature in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB).
- An alternative way is to determine the mass-radius ratio by means of gravitational redshift ($z$) measurements, through the relation $z=\sqrt{1-2 G M / R c^{2}}-1$.
