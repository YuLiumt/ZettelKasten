## Jet

It is generally agreed that for a black hole to launch jets it needs to be accreting. However, the ingredients necessary for jet formation are poorly understood. Is it the black hole spin or the rotation of the accretion disk that powers the jets?

The advent of [[General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic|general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations]] has greatly improved our understanding of jet production and its dependence on black hole spin.

 
How do jets accelerate to relativistic velocities? Is radiation pressure important in launching and accelerating the jets?
