## Intermediate Massive Black Hole (IMBH)

IMBHs are an elusive class of BHs with a mass range from $10^{2} M_{\odot}$ to $10^{5} M_{\odot}$.

perhaps formed in dense globular clusters

## Event Rate

If IMBHs are produced by accretion onto sBHs or mergers of massive stars or sBHs, then IMBHs should be abundant. On the other hand, if IMBHs are only produced from core-collapse of Pop III stars, they may have already grown into SMBHs and be rare.
