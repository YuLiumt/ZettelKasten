## Extract Thorn

Another way of doing wave extraction is using Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli first order gauge invariant wave extraction.

Here it is assumed that the 4-metric can be written as a Schwarzschild background $g_{\alpha \beta}^{Schwarz}$ with perturbations $h_{\alpha \beta}$

$$
g_{\alpha \beta}=(1-2 M / r) d t^{2}+\frac{1}{1-2 M / r} d r^{2}+r^{2} d \Omega^{2}+h_{\alpha \beta}
$$

By integrating over a coordinate sphere, the background metric parameters ($M$ and $r$) are determined and the perturbations are decomposed into tensor spherical harmonics.

These modes are then combined into the gauge invariant modes $Q_{even}^{l, m}$ and $Q_{odd}^{l, m}$ in terms of which the strain can be written as

$$
h_{+}-i h_{\times}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} r} \sum_{l, m}\left[Q_{\mathrm{even}}^{l, m}-i \int_{-\infty}^{t} Q_{\mathrm{odd}}^{l, m} d t^{\prime}\right] { }_{-2} Y^{l, m}
$$
