## BNS - Merger Fate

Observations of binary pulsars suggest that the individual stars in such systems have masses very close to $1.4 M_{\odot}$. If mass loss during the final binary coalescence can be neglected, the remnant of such a merger will then have a rest mass exceeding $3 M_{\odot}$. If this mass is larger than the maximum allowed mass for neutron star, then the merger will lead to prompt collapse to a black hole on a dynamical (millisecond) timescale. If, however, neutron stars can support such a high mass, at least temporarily, then the merger may result in a high-mass, quasi-equilibrium neutron star, which only later may collapse to a black hole. The two different outcomes may have important consequences for gravitational wave signals and, possibly, gamma-ray burst models.

Neutron stars can sustain more mass than their non-rotating limit MTOV only when rapidly rotating or extremely hot, in which case either centrifugal support or thermal gradients provide an extra term in the force-balance equation of hydrodynamic equilibrium. As the star spins down and/or cools, this extra support is lost and the star eventually reaches a point where it can no longer support its own mass and collapses to form a black hole.

- Prompt formation of black holes
	- Upon collapse, a thick accretion torus forms in the black holeâ€™s equatorial plane, potentially driving a Blandford-Znajek jet.
	- Such a scenario likely leaves an undetectable gravitational-wave signal, and little direct electromagnetic signal that can be used to infer properties of the central engine.
- Short-lived, hypermassive neutron stars
- Long-lived neutron star remnants

The numerical results show that the merger process and the first outcome are classified into three types:
- [[Hypermassive neutron stars]]

- the final product of the merger of binary neutron stars is an open question depending not only on the nuclear [[Equation of State]] for high density neutron matter but also on the rotational profile of the merged object [[Hypermassive neutron stars]].
