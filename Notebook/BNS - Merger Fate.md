## BNS - Merger Fate

Observations of binary pulsars suggest that the individual stars in such systems have masses very close to $1.4 M_{\odot}$. If mass loss during the final binary coalescence can be neglected, the remnant of such a merger will then have a rest mass exceeding $3 M_{\odot}$. If this mass is larger than the maximum allowed mass for neutron star, then the merger will lead to prompt collapse to a black hole on a dynamical (millisecond) timescale. If, however, neutron stars can support such a high mass, at least temporarily, then the merger may result in a high-mass, quasi-equilibrium neutron star, which only later may collapse to a black hole. The two different outcomes may have important consequences for gravitational wave signals and, possibly, gamma-ray burst models.

The numerical results show that the merger process and the first outcome are classified into three types:
- [[Hypermassive neutron stars]]

## Relationship Graph

- the final product of the merger of binary neutron stars is an open question depending not only on the nuclear [[Equation of State]] for high density neutron matter but also on the rotational profile of the merged object [[Hypermassive neutron stars]].
