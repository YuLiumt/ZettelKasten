# GW170817

On August 17, 2017 at 12∶41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a [[Binary Neutron Star]] inspiral.


The coincident gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations of binary neutron star merger GW170817/GRB170817A was a watershed moment, signaling the beginning of a new field of multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.

The lack of gravitational-wave observations of the merger and post-merger phase limits our inference of the remnant’s evolution.

Although the non-detection of gravitational waves means we are unable to definitively confirm the fate of the post-merger remnant of GW170817, much can be inferred through the various electromagnetic observations.
