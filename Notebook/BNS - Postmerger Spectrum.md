## BNS - Postmerger Spectrum

The postmerger spectrum exhibits several distinct peaks in the kHz range, which are connected to certain oscillation modes and dynamical features of the postmerger remnant. Understanding the physical mechanisms generating these different features is essential for the detection and interpretation of postmerger GW signals.
