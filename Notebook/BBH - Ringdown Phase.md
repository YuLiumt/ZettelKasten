## BBH - Ringdown Phase

Ground-based detectors, such as LIGO and Virgo, are most sensitive to stellar-mass BH binaries that form remnants with mass $\gtrsim 50 M_{\odot}$. As a consequence, the remnant object rings down at frequencies where the sensitivity is worse, leaving very little signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the post-merger signal.
