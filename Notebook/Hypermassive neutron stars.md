## Hypermassive neutron stars

A hypermassive neutron stars is defined as a differentially rotating NS at equilbrium with mass above the rigidly rotating limit.

Such differentially rotating stars could be secularly unstable, since viscosity or magnetic field could change the differential rotation into rigid rotation. These processes might dissipate or redistribute the angular momentum, and induce eventual gravitational collapse to a black hole.

Since the newly formed black hole seems to be rotating rapidly ($J / M_{g}^{2} \sim 0.8-0.9$), the innermost stable circular orbit is located near the event horizon and so even some of the matter located between $r=1.5 M_{g 0}$ and $3 M_{g 0}$ may go to form the disk around the black hole.
