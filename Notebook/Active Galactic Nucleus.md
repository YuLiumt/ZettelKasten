## Active Galactic Nucleus  (AGNs)

Compact emitting region in the center of a galaxy thought to be powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole

Accretion onto [[Supermassive Black Hole|supermassive black holes]] and consequent [[Jet|jet]] formation power the observed emission from AGNs. 

## Galactic outflows

Outflows on galactic scales are now commonly observed in active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies.

There is ongoing debate trying to determine whether outflows are powered by jets, winds, or radiation.

In the "radiation feedback" scenario, galactic outflows are driven by radiation pressure on dusty gas, due to the enhanced radiation-matter coupling.

AGN radiative feedback as an alternative mechanism for powering galactic outflows.
