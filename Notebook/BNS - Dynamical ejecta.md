## BNS - Dynamical ejecta

The merger process itself is responsible for the so-called dynamical ejecta, including

- [[BNS - Tidal-driven ejecta]]
- [[BNS - Shock-heated ejecta]]

The relative contribution of the two components depends on the binary total mass and mass ratio: higher total mass and mass ratio closer to unity tend to favour the shock-driven ejecta. For dynamical ejecta, magnetic field effects are typically negligible.
