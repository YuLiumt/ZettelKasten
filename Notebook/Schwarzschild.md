## Schwarzschild

The Schwarzschild solution was the first nontrivial solution of Einstein's equations found.

The Schwarzschild metric written in Schwarzschild coordinates is given by

$$
\mathrm{d} s^{2}=-\left(1-\frac{2 M}{r}\right) c^{2} \mathrm{~d} t^{2}+\frac{1}{1-\frac{2 M}{r}} \mathrm{~d} r^{2}+r^{2}\left(\mathrm{d} \theta^{2}+\sin \theta \mathrm{~d} \phi^{2}\right)
$$
Here, $r$ denotes the coordinate distance to the singularity, $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the usual angles of polar coordinates and $t$ is the time coordinate. In this coordinates, the spacetime has a coordinate singularity at $r = 2M$ while the physical singularity is at $r = 0$.
