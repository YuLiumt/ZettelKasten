## Multi-messenger astronomy

The joint detection of the gravitational wave [[GW170817]], of the short $\gamma$-ray burst GRB170817A and of the kilonova [[AT2017gfo]], generated by the the [[Binary Neutron Star|binary neutron star merger]]  observed on August 17, 2017, is a milestone in multimessenger astronomy.

The range of astronomical observation tools has been extended over the last decade not only through the inclusion of new types of astronomical messengers but also via dramatic extension of the energy window through which the Universe is observed.

## Optical telescopes

Over the last five hundred years since the invention of telescope by Galileo, our knowledge of the Universe around us was based on the information collected through the visible light photons.

Optical astronomy has been revolutionised by the [[Charged-Coupled Device]] photodetectors, of the type similar to those used e.g. in the smartphones. These detectors allow to directly record sky images in the digital form and enable the technique of massive digitized sky surveys, pioneered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
