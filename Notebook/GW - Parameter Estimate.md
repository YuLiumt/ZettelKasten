## GW - Parameter Estimate

- Compact Binaries
	- Chirp Mass
		- Since the chirp mass dominates the GW signal, $\mathcal{M}_{chirp}$ is the parameter which is measured with the highest accuracy in comparison to the mass ratio and the individual masses of the binary components.
	- Mass Ratio
	- Luminosity distance
		- The redshift of GW source can be obtained independently via extra information from EM counterparts.

## Method

A signal of known shape $h(t)$ is optimally extracted from noisy strain data $n(t)$ through a [[Matched Filtering|matched filter]] comparison with a number of templates.

[[Bayesian Inference]] is used to extract unknown parameters from gravitational wave signals.
