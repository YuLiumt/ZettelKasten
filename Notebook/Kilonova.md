## Kilonova

Kilonovae events are transient emissions in the optical or near-infrared band. They are believed to be triggered by the radioactive decay of [[r-process]] nuclei in the neutron-rich material ejected during a BNS merger.

## Relationship Graph

- Kilonova observations are a compelling proof for the link between [[SGRBs]] and [[Binary Neutron Star]] mergers.

## Light Curves

The kilonova light curves are characterized by the mass, velocity, radioactive heating, and opacity of ejecta. The element abundances which determine the radioactive heating rate and opacity of the ejecta reflect the conditions under which the ejecta are formed, such as the expansion velocity, entropy, and electron fraction ($Y_{\mathrm{e}}$). The morphology of ejecta, which is also pointed out to be an important factor to characterize the resulting light curves, also reflects the mass ejection history. Thus, the detailed observation of the kilonova emission can be used as a probe for the underlying physics in the merger process. For this purpose, the quantitative understanding of the ejecta property as well as the accurate prediction of the kilonova light curves is crucial.
