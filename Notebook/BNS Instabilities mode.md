## BNS  Instabilities mode

The detection of gravitational waves by neutron stars instabilities or oscillation modes will open the field of gravitational wave asterosysmology, which means studying the internal structure of neutron stars thanks to the GW coming from their oscillation, like the internal structure of Earth can be studied looking at earthquakes.

- The gravitational-radiation driven [[Bar Mode]] instability occurs if the star is rapidly rotating.
