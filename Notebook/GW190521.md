## GW190521

According to the LIGO-Virgo collaboration (LVC) parameter estimation, at least one of these progenitors falls into the so-called pair-instability supernova mass gap. This raises the important question of how and when these progenitors formed.

Another interesting aspect of GW190521 is that the total mass of the GW190521 remnant is $142_{-16}^{+28} M_{\odot}$, which can be considered as an [[Intermediate Massive Black Hole]].
