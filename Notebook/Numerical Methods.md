# Numerical Methods

All numerical techniques is to approximate any function by polynomials, those being the only functions than a computer can exactly calculate. So a function $u$ will be approximate by

$$
\hat{u}=\sum_{n=0}^{N} \hat{u}_{n} \Phi_{n}
$$

where the $\Phi_{n}$ are polynomials and called the trial functions. Depending on the choice of trial functions, one can generate various classes of numerical techniques.

Two types of numerical methods:

- [[Spectral Methods]] - high order polynomials on a single domain.
- **Finite elements**: low order polynomials on many domains.
