## BNS Shock-heated ejecta

The shock-heated ejecta are less neutron-rich respect to tidal interactions ejecta, because their high temperature (above $1$ MeV) allows electron-positron pairs production, which get captured by protons and neutrons respectively, emitting electronic neutrinos and antineutrinos. Given the much larger abundance of neutrons respect to protons, there are many more positron captures, leaving the matter with a higher electron fraction $Y_{e}$.
