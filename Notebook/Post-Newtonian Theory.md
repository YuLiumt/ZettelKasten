## Post-Newtonian Theory

Post-Newtonian (PN) theory is an approximation to [[General Relativity]] in the weak-field, slow-motion regime, characterized by the small parameter $\epsilon \sim(v / c)^{2} \sim \frac{G m}{r c^{2}}$, where $m$, $v$, and $r$ denote the characteristic mass, velocity, and size of the source, $c$ is the speed of light, and $G$ is Newtonâ€™s gravitational constant.


## Higher order PN terms

- The leading-order precessional effects and spin contributions to the evolution of the orbital frequency enter post-Newtonian dynamics at the 1.5 PN order (i.e., $\epsilon^{3 / 2}$) for spin-orbit effects, and 2 PN order for spin-spin effects.
