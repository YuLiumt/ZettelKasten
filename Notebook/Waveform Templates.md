# Waveform Templates

- Accurate models of the gravitational waveform are crucial in the [[Matched Filtering]] process.

While it is possible to perform NR simulations of BBH mergers for a small number of configurations, each simulation takes several weeks to run, and is too computationally expensive to use for [[GW - Parameter Estimate|GW parameter estimation]], where typically millions of waveforms with different parameters are generated and compared to the data. Further, the length of NR simulations is generally limited to tens of orbits, also due to computational expense. Therefore, computationally inexpensive waveform models are required, which reproduce the NR waveforms to a sufficient accuracy, and which can produce waveforms with the large numbers of orbits which may be visible to a gravitational wave detector.



Standard approximation methods include: 
- the post-Newtonian approximation
- [[Eï¬€ective-one-body]]
- the large-mass-ratio approximation
- [[Numerical Relativity]]

To detect the gravitational waves and elucidate the properties of their sources, one needs theoretical waveform templates. These, in turn, require solving Einstein field equations, at least approximately. Approximate techniques like post-Newtonian theory and black-hole perturbation theory can produce waveforms that are accurate for certain phases of binaries evolution. Numerical relativity, on the other hand, can in principle produce accurate waveforms models for the full binary evolution. However, such simulations are computationally very expensive for the slow inspiral phase.
