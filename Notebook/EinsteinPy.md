## EinsteinPy

- [Homepage](https://einsteinpy.org) 

EinsteinPy is a easy-to-use python library which provides a user-friendly interface for supporting numerical relativity and relativistic astrophysics research.

Many of the people working in the field of gravitational physics have theoretical background and does not have any or have little programming experience and they find using these libraries mind-boggling. EinsteinPy is motivated by this problem and provide a high level of abstraction that shed away from user all the programming and algorithmic view of the implemented numerical methods and enables anyone to simulate complicated system like binary merger with just 20-25 lines of python code.
