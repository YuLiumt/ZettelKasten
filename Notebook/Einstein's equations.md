## Einstein's equations

Einsteinâ€™s field equations of general relativity relate the geometry of spacetime to the local matter content in the universe according to

$$
G_{a b}=8 \pi T_{a b}
$$
where $G_{a b}$ is the symmetric Einstein tensor defined by

$$
G_{a b}={ }^{(4)} R_{a b}-\frac{1}{2} g_{a b}{ }^{(4)} R
$$

- For all but the simplest systems, **analytic solutions for the evolution of such systems do not exist**. Hence the task of **solving Einstein's equations must be performed numerically on a computer**. [[Numerical Relativity]]
