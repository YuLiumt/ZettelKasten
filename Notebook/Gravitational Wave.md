## Gravitational Wave

Gravitational waves are generated by the bulk motion of massive sources, if they have a quadrupolar (or higher multipolar) component, and they propagate at the speed of light, with their amplitude decaying like the inverse of the distance from the source. The more commonly familiar electromagnetic waves, instead, are generated by the incoherent superposition of the motions of microscopic charges, and have a dipolar nature.

## Relationship Graph

- Gravitational waves are one of the key prediction of Einsteinâ€™s [[General Relativity]]. 
- A primary goal of [[Numerical Relativity]] is to provide estimates of the wave strain, $h$, from strong gravitational wave sources, to be used in detector templates.
