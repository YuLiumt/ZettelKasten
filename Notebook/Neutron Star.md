# Neutron Star

Neutron Stars are a degenerate state of matter that is formed after the core collapse in a supernova event (where the electrons fall into nuclear matter and get captured by protons forming neutrons).

Excellent laboratory to study high-density nuclear physics and EOS.

The extreme condition inside a NS cannot be reproduced in a laboratory.
