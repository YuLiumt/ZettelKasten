# Neutron Star

## Maximum Mass

One of the most important characteristics of a neutron star is its maximum allowed mass.

The maximum mass of a cold, nonrotating, spherical neutron star is uniquely determined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and depends only on the cold [[Equation of State]].

- The maximum mass is crucial for distinguishing between neutron stars and black holes in compact binaries and for determining the outcome of many astrophysical processes, including supernova collapse and the merger of [[Binary Neutron Star]].
