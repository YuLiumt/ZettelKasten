## GW190814

Gravitational-wave (GW) event GW190814 has seen involved the merger of black hole (BH), with a mass of $22.2-24.3 M_{\odot}$, with a compact object having a much smaller mass of $2.50-2.67 M_{\odot}$.

The unclear nature of the secondary component has raised questions about the astrophysical evolutionary paths that would yield objects with these masses in a binary system.
