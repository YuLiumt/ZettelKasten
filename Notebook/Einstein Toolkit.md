# Einstein Toolkit

Tags: #important 

The Einstein Toolkit is a free, publicly available, community-driven [[General Relativistic]] (GR) code based on the Cactus Framework. 

Cactus is a component framework. Its components are called [[Thorns]] whereas the framework itself is called the [[Flesh]].


## Computational Units (CU)

All computations have been done in normalized computational units (hereafter denoted as CU) in which $c=G=M_{\odot}=1$. 






The spacetime metric evolution is performed by the McLachlan module, implementing a 3 + 1 dimensional split of the Einstein Equations using the BSSN-NOK formalism.


The General Relativistic Hydrodynamics (GRHD) equations are solved by the module **GRHydro**.
