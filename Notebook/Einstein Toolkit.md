The Einstein Toolkit (ET) is an open-source computational infrastructure for that allows to solve the Einstein's Equations coupled to Matter on a three-dimensional grid.

The Einstein Toolkit is a free, publicly available, community-driven General Relativity (GR) code based on the [[Cactus]] Framework. 

## Computational Units (CU)

All computations have been done in normalized computational units (hereafter denoted as CU) in which $c=G=M_{\odot}=1$. 






The spacetime metric evolution is performed by the McLachlan module, implementing a 3 + 1 dimensional split of the Einstein Equations using the BSSN-NOK formalism.


The General Relativistic Hydrodynamics (GRHD) equations are solved by the module **GRHydro**.
