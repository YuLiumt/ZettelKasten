## GW190412

This observation indicates that the astrophysical BBH population includes unequal-mass systems.

The second most important multipole, $(\ell,|m|)=(3,3)$, makes a significant, measurable contribution to the observed data.

## Spin

The asymmetric mass ratio of GW190412 allows the primary spin to have a more measurable effect on the signal. We find the primary spin magnitude to be $0.44_{-0.22}^{+0.16}$, which is the strongest constraint on the individual spin magnitude of a BH using GWs so far.
