## Dimensionless Compaction

   Only rather exotic phenomena involve sufficiently strong spacetime curvature to require numerical relativity. As is well-known, relativity becomes important when speeds approach the speed of light c, so a reasonable guess would be to expect important general relativistic effects as the escape velocity approaches c. Then an object of mass M and radius R will require relativistic treatment if R is close to the gravitational radius $r_{G} \equiv 2 G M / c^{2}$, the radius of a nonspinning black hole of mass M. The same condition can be stated in terms of the dimensionless compaction $C \equiv \frac{G M}{R c^{2}}$. Strong-gravity objects have high compaction (order unity being the standard of “high”). Black holes $(C \sim 1)$ and neutron stars $(C \sim 0.1)$ are compact objects by this definition. White dwarfs $(C \sim 10^{-4})$ are a marginal case–relativity plays a large role in their stability condition but not their equilibrium structure–and are usually also classified as compact.
