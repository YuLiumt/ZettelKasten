## BNS - Tidal-driven ejecta

 Induced by tidal forces during the last orbit before merger and the corresponding mass outflow is confined to the equatorial region.

Tidal-driven ejecta are emitted mostly in the orbital plane, and are very neutron-rich. 

Tidal ejecta are dominant in BNS mergers with high mass asymmetries. In that case, the merger is less violent, because the low mass star gets tidally deformed already in the early merger phase, so the shock heating is less strong.
