## GR - Vector

For any set of basis vectors, a four-vector $\mathbf{A}$ can be expanded in contravariant components,

$$
\mathbf{A}=A^{a} \mathbf{e}_{a}.
$$

The metric tensor can also be used to define an invariant scalar product between two four-dimensional vectors. The scalar product of two four-vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is

$$
\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}=\left(A^{a} \mathbf{e}_{a}\right) \cdot\left(B^{b} \mathbf{e}_{b}\right)=g_{a b} A^{a} B^{b}.
$$
In particular, the square-magnitude of a 4-vector can be defined as

$$
\mathbf{A}^{2}=g_{a b} A^{a} A^{b}.
$$
Notice that this is not positive definite, so we usually donâ€™t take its square root. We can then classify vectors just as intervals into spacelike, timelike and null. It is now clear that the interval $d s^{2}$ is nothing more than the square-magnitude of the (infinitesimal) displacement vector itself.
