## BNS Tidal Deformability

During the inspiral phase (before contact), BNS systems differ from the BBH ones by the presence of tidal interactions which affect both the dynamics of the inspiral and the emitted waveform.

- The tidal deformability of neutron stars has been proposed as one of the most promising quantities related to the [[Equation of State]] that can be extracted from the [[Gravitational Wave]] observation.
	- For the early stage of the inspiral, the waveforms including the linear-order tidal effects derived by post-Newtonian (PN) calculation are useful. However, the PN expansion becomes invalid as the orbit becomes relativistic, and thus, the error of the waveform becomes large in the late stage. Such errors would cause the systematic bias in the parameter estimation, and it would be in particular problematic for estimating the tidal deformability because the tidal effects on the waveform become most significant just before the merger.
