## BNS  Tidal-driven ejecta

Tidal-driven ejecta are emitted mostly in the orbital plane, and are very neutron-rich. 

Tidal ejecta are dominant in BNS mergers with high mass asymmetries. In that case, the merger is less violent, because the low mass star gets tidally deformed already in the early merger phase, so the shock heating is less strong.
