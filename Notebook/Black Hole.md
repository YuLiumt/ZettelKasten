## Black Hole

The boundary of a black hole is the [[Event Horizon|event horizon]]. Nothing can escape from within this horizon, not even light.


## No-hair conjecture

The no-hair conjecture in General Relativity (GR) states that the properties of an astrophysical Kerr black hole (BH) are completely described by its mass and spin.

One consequence of the no-hair conjecture is that the QNM frequencies of gravitational radiation emitted by a perturbed isolated BH are uniquely determined by its mass and spin. Hence a test of the no-hair conjecture would involve checking for consistency between estimates of mass and spin of the remnant object across multiple QNM frequencies.
