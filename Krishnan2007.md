## Highlight

- The spin contributions to the recoil velocity are generally larger than those due to the unequal masses, and, in particular, the spin component in the orbital plane has the largest effect.
- The starting point of our analysis is the quasi-local description of black hole horizons as provided by the isolated, dynamical, and trapping horizon formalisms. These techniques have been successfully applied to black-hole binaries to extract the mass and spins (magnitude and direction) of the individual holes and the merger remnant, as well as measure the precession of the spin direction and spin flips.
