## Modeling the remnant mass, spin, and recoil from unequal-mass, precessing black-hole binaries: The intermediate mass ratio regime

- **Author**: Zlochower Y, [[Carlos Lousto]].
- **Summary**:
	- We provide a set of empirical formulas for the final mass, spin, and recoil velocity of the final black hole as a function of the mass ratio and individual spins of the progenitor.
	- In order to determine the fitting coefficients for these formulas, we perform a set of 128 new numerical evolutions of precessing, unequal-mass black-hole binaries, and fit to the resulting remnant mass, spin, and recoil.

## Highlight

 

- In appendix we provide detailed data for the 126 new BHB configurations studied here. Our configurations have one BH spinning (generally the larger one) and the other non-spinning.
