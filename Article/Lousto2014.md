## Highlight

- We can also define a purely coordinate based measure of the orbital angular momentum direction using the coordinate trajectory $\vec{r}(t)$, given by $$\hat{L}_{\text {coord }}=\frac{\vec{r}(t) \times \dot{\vec{r}}(t)}{|\vec{r}(t) \times \dot{\vec{r}}(t)|}$$  
	- Note that while this equation resembles the Newtonian definition of angular momentum, we apply it to fully non-linear numerical trajectories, thus including relativistic corrections.
- In the text below, when needed for clarity, we refer to $\hat{L}(t)$ as the radiation angular momentum and $\hat{L}_{\text {coord }}(t)$ as the coordinate angular momentum.
- For a given configuration, the maximum precession occurs near merger.
