## Final mass and spin of black-hole mergers

- **Author**: [[Wolfgang Tichy]], Marronetti P.
- **Summary**:
	- By fitting to numerical results we construct analytic formulas that predict the mass and spin of the final black hole.
		- Our formulas are valid for arbitrary initial spins and mass ratios and agree well with available numerical simulations.

## Highlight

- Predicting the final $m$ and $\vec{s}$ from the initial parameters is of great importance in many astrophysical merger scenarios.
	- After the merger the final BH is characterized by seven parameters, the final mass $m=M_{f} /\left(M_{a}+M_{b}\right)$, the spin $\vec{s}=\overrightarrow{S_{f}} / M_{f}^{2}$ and the kick velocity $\vec{k}$.
- Our coordinate system is such that the $z$ axis is perpendicular to the initial orbital plane. The center of mass is initially at rest at the origin.
- To linear order, the spin expansions for the final mass and spin are: $$\begin{array}{l} m=m^{0}+\left(m^{a 1} a_{z}+m^{b 1} b_{z}\right) \\ s_{x}=\left(s_{x}^{a 1} a_{x}+s_{x}^{b 1} b_{x}\right)+\left(s_{x}^{a 2} a_{y}+s_{x}^{b 2} b_{y}\right) \\ s_{y}=\left(s_{y}^{a 1} a_{x}+s_{y}^{b 1} b_{x}\right)+\left(s_{y}^{a 2} a_{y}+s_{y}^{b 2} b_{y}\right) \\ s_{z}=s_{z}^{0}+\left(s_{z}^{a 1} a_{z}+s_{z}^{b 1} b_{z}\right) \end{array}$$ where the coefficients are functions of the mass ratio $q$ and the initial orbital angular velocity $\omega$.
- Our particular mapping of initial masses and spins into the final mass and spin was fitted for the initial orbital angular velocity $\omega=0.05$. 
	- If we start with the same initial spin components but at lower initial angular velocity (i.e. larger separation) the individual spins and the orbital plane will have precessed by the time we reach $\omega=0.05$.
	- Note that the $\omega$ dependence of our formula is removed by the integration over the spin orientation.
