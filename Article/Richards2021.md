## Relativistic Bondi accretion for stiff equations of state

- **Author**: Richards C B, Baumgarte T W, [[Stuart L. Shapiro]]
- **Summary**:
	- For stiffer equations of state, with $\Gamma>5 / 3$, the Newtonian approach yields unphysical solutions, so that this case requires a fully relativistic treatment.
	- It arises in the hypothetical scenario of a small, possibly primordial, black hole residing at the center of a neutron star.
