## Spritz: General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics with Neutrinos

- **Author**: Cipolletta F, Vijay Kalinani J, Giangrandi E, [[Bruno Giacomazzo]], [[Riccardo Ciolfi]], Sala L, Giudici B.
- **Summary**:
	- A new version of the publicly available general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code Spritz, which now includes an approximate neutrino leakage scheme able to handle neutrino cooling and heating.
		- The leakage scheme is based on the publicly available ZelmaniLeak code.
		- The new version of the Spritz code can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4350072#.X-FmIC0RrfY) as version 1.1.0.

## Highlight

- In order to properly model the merger and post-merger evolution of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers and thus establish a reliable connection with their multimessenger observations, one needs to account not only for general relativistic effects, but also for other key physical ingredients such as magnetic fields, a temperature and composition dependent equation of state describing the behaviour of matter, and neutrino emission and re-absorption.
