## The NANOGrav 11 yr Data Set: Limits on Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in Galaxies within 500 Mpc

- **Author**: [[NANOGrav Collaboration]]
- **Summary**:
	- We analyzed the NANOGrav 11 yr dataset to derive limits on tentative binaries in nearby galaxies.
		- We found that 216 massive and relatively nearby galaxies are within the volume NANOGrav can probe.
		- We obtained mass ratio upper limits as a function of frequency for each of those galaxies.

## Highlight

- At sub-parsec separations, supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) become strong sources of low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), targeted by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs).
	- With the NANOGrav 11 yr upper limits, we have already excluded the presence of a circular equal-mass binary, with chirp mass $\mathcal{M}>1.6 \times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$, emitting in the frequency range between $2.8 \mathrm{~nHz}$ to $317.8 \mathrm{~nHz}$, in the Virgo Cluster.
	- Here, we extend the astrophysical inference based on the 11 yr dataset beyond the Virgo Cluster.
		- We construct a comprehensive galaxy catalog, which contains all the massive nearby galaxies, using the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS).
			- Our catalog includes only relatively nearby galaxies ($z<0.05$). As the sensitivities of PTAs improve, and in turn the distances to which they can probe increase, redshifts should be incorporated in future analyses.
		- We carefully determine the galaxy distances and the masses of their SMBHs.
			- In the local volume, converting redshift to distance is not trivial because the spectroscopically measured velocities are significantly affected by the motion of galaxies.
		- We select a subset of 216 galaxies which are in the sensitivity volume of NANOGrav, i.e., they would emit detectable GWs if they hosted equal mass circular binaries at 8 nHz.
			- We calculated the GW strain amplitude from $h_{\mathrm{GW}}=\frac{2(G \mathcal{M})^{5 / 3}\left(\pi f_{\mathrm{GW}}\right)^{2 / 3}}{c^{4} D}$, $D$ is the luminosity distance, $f_{\mathrm{GW}}$ the observed GW frequency, and $\mathcal{M}$ the chirp mass, $\mathcal{M}=\left[\frac{q}{(1+q)^{2}}\right]^{3 / 5} M_{\mathrm{tot}}$, where $M_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total mass and $q$ the mass ratio.
			- We derived the GW upper limits towards the direction of each galaxy.

				- The sensitivity of NANOGrav depends on the spatial distribution of pulsars on the sky and is highly anisotropic.
			- Using the upper limits of the relevant pixel, we obtained mass ratio upper limits as a function of frequency for each of those galaxies.
