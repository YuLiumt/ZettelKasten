## Highlight

- Currently, there are no ready-to-use waveform models that accurately combine both eccentricity and spin effects over the entire parameter space.
	- Parameter estimates of all gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescing binaries are done under the assumption that the inspiral is quasi-circular.
		- This is motivated by the efficient circularization of the inspiral due to gravitational wave emission.
		- In addition, no explicit evidence for eccentricity for some events was found.
	- Active galactic nuclei and globular clusters may host a population of eccentric binaries.
