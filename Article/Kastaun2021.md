## Numerical Inside View of Hypermassive Remnant Models for GW170817

- **Author**: [[Wolfgang Kastaun]], [[Frank Ohme]].
- **Summary**:
	- We perform standard hydrodynamical numerical simulations of a system compatible with GW170817.
		- We focus on a single equation of state (EOS) and two mass ratios, while neglecting magnetic fields and neutrino radiation.
		- We investigate the evolution of mass and angular momentum distribution up to collapse, as well as the differential rotation along and perpendicular to the equatorial plane.
	- The remnant cannot be adequately modeled as a differentially rotating axisymetric NS.
	- The dominant aspect leading to collapse is the GW radiation and not internal redistribution of angular momentum.
