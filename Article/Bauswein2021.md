## Equation of state constraints from multi-messenger observations of neutron star mergers

- **Author**: Bauswein A
- **Summary**:
	- How the multi-messenger observations of GW170817 provide a lower limit on NS radii and the nuclear EoS with a minimum of assumptions.
		- Employs a minimum set of assumptions, the radii of neutron stars with typical masses should be larger than about $10.7 ~km$.

## Highlight

- From hydrodynamical simulations, one cannot easily distinguish dynamical and secular ejecta which can be comparable in mass.
- It is interesting to note that the amount of dynamical ejecta critically depends on the immediate outcome of the merger. If the merging leads to a prompt gravitational collapse on a dynamical time scale, the ejecta mass is significantly reduced compared to the case where a NS merger remnant forms which survives for at least a few milliseconds or longer.
