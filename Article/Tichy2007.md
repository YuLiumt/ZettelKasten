## Binary black hole mergers: Large kicks for generic spin orientations

- **Author**: [[Wolfgang Tichy]], Marronetti P. 
- **Summary**:
	- We performed several simulations of black hole binaries on initially approximately circular orbits with spins in arbitrary directions.
		- Higher spins will lead to even larger kicks.

## Highlight

- For a binary in almost circular orbit, the direction of the instantaneous linear momentum flux rotates in the orbital plane with the angular velocity of the system. Thus, when the binary goes through one orbital period, the average linear momentum flux will be close to zero. The only net effect comes from the fact that the inspiral orbits are not perfect circles. Most of the kick is thus accumulated during the last orbit and subsequent plunge of the two holes, when the motion of the two holes is no longer quasi-circular and the averaged linear momentum flux is much larger.
- Since our simulations have no particular symmetries we cannot use the usual memory saving techniques and simulate only one quadrant of the numerical domain. This makes standard convergence tests very costly. Thus, the goal of this work is merely to give kick velocity estimates which can be used in astrophysics, instead of extremely accurate results.
	- For the same reason, we present a convergence test for only one particular case in order to establish that our numerical setup gives results that are in the convergent regime.
- The energy radiated during the merger of a binary where both initial spins have magnitude $S / m^{2}=0.8$ and are anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum.

- Almost the entire kick is accumulated during the final merger phase, meaning that small changes in the initial conditions are likely to lead to quite different kick directions and magnitudes.
