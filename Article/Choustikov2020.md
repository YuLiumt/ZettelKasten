## Highlight

- The Einstein Toolkit represents a unique opportunity for students to explore the world of numerical relativity, without the need for high-level computing power or knowledge of the mathematics behind the simulations themselves.
- In order to ease installation and use of the toolkit, it is recommended to use a Linux distribution.
- In order to run a simulation, it is necessary to write a parameter file (`.par` or `.rpar`) which tells the toolkit which thorns to use, along with the desired parameters
