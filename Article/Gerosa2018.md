## Black-hole kicks from numerical-relativity surrogate models

- **Author**: Gerosa D, Hébert F, [[Leo C. Stein]].
- **Summary**:
	- Uses a numerical relativity surrogate model to obtain the gravitational waveform given a set of binary parameters, then from this waveform we directly integrate the gravitational-wave linear momentum flux.
	- Our extraction procedure is made publicly available as a module for the Python programming language named surrkick.

## Highlight

- Binary black holes radiate linear momentum in gravitational waves as they merge. Recoils imparted to the black-hole remnant can reach thousands of $km/s$, thus ejecting black holes from their host galaxies.
