## Highlight

- How should we define the surface of the black hole? 
	- The obvious candidate is the event horizon. Unfortunately, this is not a viable possibility because event horizons are extremely global and teleological.
	- One avoids the problems associated with the global and teleological nature of the event horizon by locating apparent horizons at each time during evolution.
		- Apparent horizons can and do jump during evolution.
