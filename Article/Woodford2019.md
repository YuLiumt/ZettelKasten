## Highlight

- Gravitational waveforms created through numerical relativity are generally the most accurate waveforms available, and are used for parameter estimation and to compare and improve semianalytic and analytic models of BBHs, which in turn are used for gravitational-wave detection and parameter estimation.
- The center-of-mass motions found in the SXS catalog are effectively random and apparently independent of any physical parameters of the systems.
