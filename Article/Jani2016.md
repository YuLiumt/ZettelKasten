## Georgia tech catalog of gravitational waveforms

- **Author**: Jani K, Healy J, Clark J A, London L, Laguna P, Shoemaker D.
- **Summary**:
	- Currently, the catalog consists of 452 distinct waveforms. 128 of the waveforms are from binaries with black hole spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum, and 324 are from precessing binary black hole systems. 
		- The waveforms from binaries with non-spinning black holes have mass-ratios $q=m_{1} / m_{2} \leq 15$, and those with precessing, spinning black holes have $q \leq 8$.
	- Predictions of the mass and spin of the final black hole by phenomenological fits are tested against the results from the simulation bank.

## Highlight

- All the BBH simulations in the GT catalog were obtained with Maya code.
	- Maya is very similar to the Einstein code in the EinsteinToolkit. That is, it operates under the Cactus infrastructure, with Carpet providing mesh refinements and thorns (modules) generated by the package Kranc.
	- The extraction is done in the source frame such that the initial orbital angular momentum of the binary is pointing in the positive z-direction.
- Each of the 452 waveforms in the catalog have a unique identifier of the form GTXXXX. The catalog is organized by folders. Each folder contains the following information:
	- Initial parameters of BBH system
	- Parameter file of the simulation
	- BH trajectories
	- Mass, spin and gravitational recoil of the final BH
	- Radiated energy, linear momentum and angular momentum
	- $\Psi_{4}$ decomposed in spin-weighted spherical harmonics with $\ell \leq 8$ and different extraction radii
- The waveforms are given in terms of an adjustable mass scale (the total mass $M=m_{1}+m_{2}$ of the BBH system); and, therefore, they can be rescaled for both ground and space-based GW detectors.
	- The NR waveforms presented the catalog include the early phase of the simulation that is contaminated with the junk radiation in the initial data. The segment of the waveform with orbital frequencies $\leq M \omega_{\mathrm{orb}}$ should hence be ignored. For a given low-frequency cutoff of a GW detector, $f_{\min}$, the waveform can be scaled to a minimum total mass as $M=k\left(M \omega_{\text {orb }} / f_{\min }\right)$, where $k=3.23 \times 10^{4}$.
	- A significant fraction of the waveforms have enough GW cycles that can be used in improving phenomenological or EOB models.
- Typical numerical errors in GW strain for GT catalog.

	- The mismatches are computed between two finite numerical grid resolutions and finite waveform extraction radius.
	- These match calculations involve advanced LIGO noise curve and total-mass of BBH scaled at $100 M_{\odot}$.
- Binary systems with high final BH spin radiate the most energy.

- For each waveform, we compute their mismatch with both SEOBNRv2 and IMRPhenomPv2, where the mismatch is given by $$\text { mismatch }=1-\max _{t_{0}, \phi_{0}} \frac{\left(h_{1} \mid h_{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\left(h_{1} \mid h_{1}\right)\left(h_{2} \mid h_{2}\right)}} \tag{1}$$ where the inner product is given by $$\left(h_{1} \mid h_{2}\right)=4 \operatorname{Re} \int_{f_{\min }}^{\infty} \frac{\tilde{h_{1}}(f) \tilde{h_{2}}^{*}(f)}{S_{h}(f)} \mathrm{d} f \tag{2}$$
	- We set as low-frequency cutoff $f_{\min }=30 \mathrm{~Hz}$ and use a noise spectrum representative of advanced LIGO in its early configuration.
	- Both the waveforms, NR and the approximant models, are projected to the same optimal sky-location and orientation.
