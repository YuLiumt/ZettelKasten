## Exploring the Small Mass Ratio Binary Black Hole Merger via Zeno's Dichotomy Approach

- **Author**: [[Carlos Lousto]], [[James Healy]].
- **Summary**:
	- We perform a sequence of binary black hole simulations with increasingly small mass ratios, reaching to a 128:1 binary that displays 13 orbits before merger.
		- Roughly a linear computational resources scaling with $1/q$ is observed.
	- We compute the remnant properties of the merger: final mass, spin, and recoil velocity. We compare those values with predictions of the corresponding phenomenological formulas.
		- We then use the new results to improve their fitting coefficients.

## Highlight

- (2,2) modes of the strain waveforms, for the $q = 1/15, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128$ simulations.

- An important test of accuracy of our simulations is to compare the final properties versus the predictions of the formulas obtained in Ref. [[Healy2017a]].

- In light of these good results, we can now use the current data to generate a new fit of the nonspinning binary remnant and merger waveform properties.
	- The fitting formula for $M_{\mathrm{rem}}$ is given by $$\begin{aligned} \frac{M_{\mathrm{rem}}}{m}=&(4 \eta)^{2}\left\{M_{0}+K_{2 d} \delta m^{2}+K_{4 f} \delta m^{4}\right\} \\ &+\left[1+\eta\left(\tilde{E}_{\mathrm{ISCO}}+11\right)\right] \delta m^{6} \end{aligned} \tag{1}$$ where $\delta m=\left(m_{1}-m_{2}\right) / m$ and $m=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)$ and $4 \eta=$ $1-\delta m^{2}$.
	- The final spin has the form $$\begin{aligned} \alpha_{\mathrm{rem}}=& \frac{S_{\mathrm{rem}}}{M_{\mathrm{rem}}^{2}}=(4 \eta)^{2}\left\{L_{0}+L_{2 d} \delta m^{2}+L_{4 f} \delta m^{4}\right\} \\ &+\eta \tilde{J}_{\mathrm{ISCO}} \delta m^{6} \end{aligned} \tag{2}$$ 
	- For the nonspinning recoil $$v_{m}=\eta^{2} \delta m\left(A+B \delta m^{2}+C \delta m^{4}\right) \tag{3}$$
	- We model the peak amplitude (of the strain $h$) $$\left(\frac{r}{m}\right) h_{\text {peak }}=(4 \eta)^{2}\left\{H_{0}+H_{2 d} \delta m^{2}+H_{4 f} \delta m^{4}\right\}+\eta \tilde{H}_{p} \delta m^{6} \tag{4}$$ where $\tilde{H}_{p}\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{rem}}\right)$ is the particle limit, taking the value $H_{p}(0)=1.4552857$ in the nonspinning limit.
	- The formula to model the peak luminosity $$\mathcal{L}_{\text {peak }}=(4 \eta)^{2}\left\{N_{0}+N_{2 d} \delta m^{2}+N_{4 f} \delta m^{4}\right\} \tag{5}$$
	- We model the peak frequency of the (2,2) mode of the gravitational wave strain $$m \omega_{22}^{\text {peak }}=(4 \eta)\left\{W_{0}+W_{2 d} \delta m^{2}+W_{4 f} \delta m^{4}\right\}+\tilde{\Omega}_{p} \delta m^{6} \tag{6}$$ where $\tilde{\Omega}_{p}\left(\alpha_{\text {rem }}\right)$ is the particle limit, taking the value $\tilde{\Omega}_{p}(0)=0.279525$ in the nonspinning limit.
	- Table III summarizes the new values of all those coefficients with their estimated errors.

## Convergence

- For the $q=1 / 15$ case, we performed three globally increasing resolution simulations labeled by its number of points per total mass $m=m_{1}+m_{2}$, n084, n100, n120.
	- The medium resolution "n100" simulation has $40$ grid points across a radius of $0.08m$ for a finest resolution of $m/512$ at the innermost refinement level around the smaller hole.
	- The whole grid consists of $12$ refinement levels with an outer boundary at $400m$ and in the wavezone, the resolution is $m / 1.0$.
	- The n100 simulation proceeded at a speed of $2.2m/hr$ on 8 of TACC's stampede2 nodes, costing approximately 5,340 node hours.
- The detail of the convergence of the waveform phase and amplitude with global numerical resolution is shown in Fig. 1 displaying an eighth order convergence rate.

	- The high convergence of these results allow us to use the medium of the resolutions, n100, as the reference grid to perform a set of smaller $q$ simulations, each time halving the mass ratio and adding a new refinement level around the smaller hole (12, 13, 14, 15 levels for $q =1/15$, $1/32$, $1/64$, $1/128$, respectively).
		- This basic grid configuration ensures exactly the same accuracy around the larger hole, the radiation and boundary zones, and in between the holes, while doubling the resolution around the smaller hole in such a way that the number of points per horizon remains the same and guarantees its accuracy.
		- The simulations of $q = 1/32, 1/64, 1/128$ have all been performed in TACC's Frontera cluster on 8 nodes (448 cores) at speeds of 1.1, 0.6, and 0.32 m per hour totaling 13,807, 17,713, and 41,250 node hours respectively.
