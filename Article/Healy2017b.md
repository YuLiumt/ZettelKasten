## Highlight

- $\left(\chi_{1}^{x}, \chi_{1}^{y}, \chi_{1}^{z}\right)$ are specified in a frame where $\hat{L}=(0,0,1)$, i.e. the Newtonian orbital angular momentum is along the z-axis. The vector $\hat{n}$ pointing from $m_{2}$ to $m_{1}$ is the x-axis, $(1,0,0)$.
- Due to the way NR simulations are set-up the initial parameters can change due to the presence of junk radiation and/or imperfections in setting up initial data, therefore these quantities should be reported as after-junk masses/spins, ideally extracted at the reference frequency.
- For the precessing simulations, since the spins will now evolve, we determine the initial data parameters by choosing the initial spins at the specified reference frequency.
	- The initial data used by SXS, being not conformally flat have less spurious radiation content than the Bowen-York data and hence produce a different set of masses and spins after settling down.
- The initial spurious burst contains a non-negligible kick which causes a center of mass drift.
	- Because of this, information from the dominant $\ell=2$, $m=\pm 2$ modes leak into the other modes.
