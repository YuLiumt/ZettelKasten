## A higher-multipole gravitational waveform model for an eccentric binary black holes based on the effective-one-body-numerical-relativity formalism

- **Author**: Liu X, Cao Z, Zhu Z-H.
- **Summary**:
	- We extended our previous SEOBNRE waveform model to SEOBNREHM to cover higher modes.
	- SEOBNREHM waveform model can match all tested 305 SXS waveforms better than $98 \%$ including highly spinning $(\chi=0.99)$ BBH, highly eccentric $(e \approx 0.15)$ BBH and large mass ratio $(q=10)$ BBH.

## Highlight

- Due to the GW190521 like events, the demand of waveform template for eccentric binary black holes increases.
- We have constructed SEOBNRE waveform model which extends the waveform model SEOBNRv1 for spin-aligned circular BBH to spin-aligned eccentric cases.
	- SEOBNRE waveform model works only for (2,2) mode waveform.
- Our current SEOBNREHM waveform model not only extends SEOBNRE to high modes but also improves the accuracy for (2,2) mode due to the resummation skill and the calibration to SEOBNRv4 waveforms.

- Given two waveforms $h_{1}(t)$ and $h_{2}(t)$, we define matching factor $(\mathrm{FF})$ by inner product $\left\langle h_{1} \mid h_{2}\right\rangle$ with respect to a detector noise $$\begin{aligned} \left\langle h_{1} \mid h_{2}\right\rangle &=4 \mathcal{R} \int_{f_{\min }}^{f_{\max }} \frac{\tilde{h}_{1}(f) \tilde{h}_{2}^{*}(f)}{S_{n}(f)} \mathrm{d} f \\ \mathrm{FF} & \equiv \max _{t_{c}, \varphi_{c}} \frac{\left\langle h_{1} \mid h_{2}\right\rangle}{\sqrt{\left\langle h_{1} \mid h_{1}\right\rangle\left\langle h_{2} \mid h_{2}\right\rangle}} \end{aligned}$$ where $S_{n}(f)$ is the one-sided power spectral density (PSD) of the detector noise. The detector frequency band $\left(f_{\min}, f_{\max}\right)=(10 \mathrm{~Hz}, 8192 \mathrm{~Hz})$ we used here is the designed sensitivity of the advanced LIGO.
