## Highlight

- We use a grid structure with between 9 and 11 levels of refinement, depending on mass ratio and spin.
	- For the highly-spinning horizons, we added an additional level inside the horizon of width roughly half of the horizon diameter.
- The finest level around each BH was as wide as twice the diameter of the relaxed horizon (the number of points across each horizon was between 28 and 60).
