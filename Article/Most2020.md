## Fast ejecta as a potential way to distinguish black holes from neutron stars in high-mass gravitational-wave events

- **Author**: [[Elias Roland Most]], Papenfort L J, Tootle S, Rezzolla L.
- **Summary**:
	- How the merger of two NSs can be distinguished from the merger of a NS and a BH when the gravitational-wave detection is not sufficiently accurate to place a lower bound on the tidal deformability of the system.
	- Our attention here is particularly focused on the potential differences between NS–NS and BH–NS mergers in the near equal-mass regime.

## Highlight

- The initial data is constructed using the publicly available LORENE code.
- Assuming that no BHs are likely to be formed with masses $M_{\mathrm{BH}}<M_{\mathrm{TOV}}$, we focus on the limiting value of $M_{\mathrm{BH}} \simeq M_{\mathrm{TOV}}$, which would model a BH–NS system derived from NS–NS binary where the BH is produced by means of a continued mass accretion.

	- It is possible to note that the overall picture is remarkably similar.
	- Despite the qualitative analogies between the BH–NS and NSNS binaries in our simulations, we crucially, find that for NS–NS systems an additional arm of mass ejection rapidly emanating from the merger site.
		- This additional mass ejection represents a second tidal tail, propagating in a direction that is opposite to that of the main tidal tail.
		- The largest tidal tail is not produced by the secondary (as it necessarily is for the BH–NS binary) but likely by the spin-up of the primary.
	- In summary, the formation of a double tidal-arm structure is a unique feature of NS–NS mergers, distinguishing them from corresponding BH–NS mergers with comparable mass, and is intrinsically associated with the presence of a second NS in the system.
	- The primary is already close to the critical stability limit to collapse, the merged object almost instantaneously collapses to a BH at merger.
- The low-mass tidal arm from the secondary is composed of matter that is ejected at substantially large velocities, i.e., it can be considered as being mostly made of “fast ejecta” and, for this reason, will have a qualitatively different impact on the electromagnetic counterpart produced in the NS–NS binaries.
- We record the mass ejection until the primary (tidal) arm has fully passed the detector.
