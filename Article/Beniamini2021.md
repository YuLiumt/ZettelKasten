## Highlight

- Numerical simulations of the gravitational wave (GW) driven dynamical merger process show that the initial remnant is supported against gravitational collapse by strong differential rotation and partially by thermal pressure.
- However, simulations have not been able to capture the full range of lengthscales and physical processes needed to understand the transport of angular momentum by e.g., Kelvin-Helmholtz and magneto-rotational instabilities.
- As we are interested in systems surviving for time-scales longer than the GRB prompt duration we focus on cold and uniformly rotating NSs, assuming that the differential rotation has subsided (on timescale of $\sim 0.1 \mathrm{~s}$) and neutrino cooling has ended (on timescale of $\sim 1 \mathrm{~s}$).
	- We apply realistic equations of state (EOS) using the rns code to simulate models of uniformly rotating cold NSs and consider different energy loss mechanisms.
