- **Summary**:
	- We find no evidence for a late-time radio re-brightening at a mean epoch of $t \approx 1200 \mathrm{~d}$ since merger.

## Highlight

- GW170817 has been a milestone event for transient multi-messenger studies. It was the first binary neutron star (NS) merger observed by the LIGO and VIRGO detectors, and so far it remains the only binary NS system from which gravitational waves (GWs) and a multi-wavelength (radio to gamma-ray) counterpart have been discovered.
- Several theoretical scenarios predict the possible emergence at late times of detectable electromagnetic emission associated with the afterglow of the kilonova ejecta itself.
- Our late-time radio observations of GW170817 do not provide evidence for radio emission in excess to what is expected from the very late time tail of a structured jet afterglow model (black solid line).
