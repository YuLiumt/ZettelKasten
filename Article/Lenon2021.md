## Eccentric Binary Neutron Star Search Prospects for Cosmic Explorer

- **Author**: Lenon A K, Brown D A, Nitz A H.
- **Summary**:
	- We investigate the ability of Cosmic Explorer to detect eccentric binary neutron stars and to measure their eccentricity.
		- To model eccentric sources, we use the LIGO Algorithm Library implementation of TaylorF2Ecc, a frequency-domain post-Newtonian model with eccentric corrections.
		- To model non-eccentric waveforms, we use the restricted TaylorF2 approximant.

## Highlight

- Although most of the detected neutron-star binaries will be in circular orbits, measurement of eccentricity in neutron-star mergers allows us to explore their formation and to distinguish between field binaries, which are expected to be circular by the time they are observed, and binaries formed through other channels.
	- Dynamical interactions can form binary neutron stars with eccentricity that is measurable, although the predicted rate of these mergers detectable by current gravitational-wave observatories is small.
