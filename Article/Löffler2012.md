## Highlight

- The mechanisms for the development and support of the Einstein Toolkit are designed to be open, transparent and community-driven.
	- Almost all discussions about the toolkit take place on an open mail list.
	- The regular weekly meetings for the Einstein Toolkit are open and the community is invited to participate.
	- Every substantial change or addition to the toolkit must be reviewed by another Einstein Toolkit maintainer, and is generally open for discussion on the users mailing list.
