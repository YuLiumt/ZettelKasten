## Gravitational-Wave Signature of a First-Order Quantum Chromodynamics Phase Transition in Core-Collapse Supernovae

- **Author**: Zha S, O’Connor E P, Chu M-c, Lin L-M, Couch S M.
- **Summary**:
	- It is unclear whether the PT-induced collapse of PCS in CCSNe can leave an imprint in the GW signal.
		- We carry out CCSN simulations in two dimensions with the assumption of axisymmetry, using the [[FLASH]] code.
		- A simplified hybrid EOS employs the STOS EOS for the hadronic phase and the MIT bag model EOS for the quark phase, with the Gibbs construction for the mixed phase.
			- The hybrid equation of state publicly available at the [[CompOSE]] website.
		- The PT inside a CCSN can be inferred from the GW detection. However, the louder burst is not necessarily easier to detect because of the increasing noise level of high frequencies for current ground based GW detectors.

## Highlight

- Free quarks [[Quark]]
	- Free quarks should exist in the early Universe when the temperature is extremely high ($k_{B} T \gtrsim 150 \mathrm{MeV}$).
	- They may also exist in the cold and superdense interior of compact stars with a density above the nuclear saturation density ($\rho_{\mathrm{sat}} \simeq 2.6 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$).
	- Moreover, a first-order quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition (PT), i.e., hadron-quark PT, may take place in the protocompact stars (PCS) produced by a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) or binary neutron-star merger.
- To show the consequences of the PT, we run two simulations with the same settings, one using the hybrid EOS and the other using the STOS EOS.
	- Dynamics
		![[Pasted image 20201223151250.png]]
		- Using the FLASH code with an "M1" scheme for the neutrino transport. We take the $12 M_{\odot}$, solar-metallicity, presupernova progenitor s12 as the initial conditions.
		- The iron core of the s12 model collapses to above $\rho_{\text {sat }}$ and bounces at $t_{b} \simeq 151 \mathrm{~ms}$ for both EOSs.
		- At $t_{b}$, the core of the hybrid EOS has already entered the mixed phase with a central quark mass fraction $X_{q}=18 \%$.
		- During the accretion phase, the central density $\rho_{c}$ of the PCS with the hybrid EOS is always larger than that of the PNS with the STOS EOS and $X_{q}$ continuously increases.
		- The mass of the PCS grows and reaches the maximum of the second family for the hybrid EOS at $\sim t_{b}+286 \mathrm{~ms}$. The PCS becomes unstable against gravity and experiences a second dynamical collapse. The PCS core enters the pure quark phase ($X_{q}=1$).
		- The pure quark core bounces in less than $1 \mathrm{~ms}$ at $t_{2 b}$ as the PCS enters the new stable branch of the third family and $\rho_{c}$ drops to $\sim 5 \rho_{sat}$. This bounce shock expands quickly to explode the outer envelope.
		- The PT-induced collapse is associated with a second neutrino burst with more electron antineutrinos than electron neutrinos.

		- There is no qualitative difference between the two waveforms until $t_{2 b}$ and the cumulative emitted GW energies are quantitatively similar.
		- The maximum amplitude of $h_{+}$ reaches $10^{-20}$ and $\sim 30$ times larger than those of the other episodes.
		- Due to the much larger $\rho_{c}$ and compactness of the PCS for the hybrid EOS, the peak GW frequency is $2-3$ times higher than that for the STOS EOS.
	- The detectability of the GW signals

		- Below $\sim 1000 \mathrm{~Hz}$, $h_{char}$ are quantitatively similar for the hybrid and STOS EOSs. At higher frequencies, $h_{char}$ for the hybrid EOS shows a broad peak between $\sim 2500-4000 \mathrm{~Hz}$ which is also above the detector's sensitivity curve. This part is mainly contributed by the burst associated with the PT-induced collapse, seen from the comparison between the entire $h_{char}$ and that between $t_{2 b}-3 \mathrm{~ms}$ and $t_{2 b}+7 \mathrm{~ms}$.
