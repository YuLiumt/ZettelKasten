* **Summary**:
    - We presented an algorithm for matching PN precession dynamics to NR simulations. Using this algorithm, we perform a systematic comparison between PN and NR for precessing binary black hole systems.
		- We find excellent agreement between PN and NR for the precession and nutation of the orbital plane.

## Highlight

- Recently, the SXS collaboration has published numerical-relativity solutions to the full Einstein equations for precessing BBH systems. Therefore, they offer a novel opportunity to systematically quantify the accuracy of the post-Newtonian precession equations. [[SXS Catalog]]
- Considering the orbital-phase evolution, we find that the disagreement between post-Newtonian orbital phase and numerical relativity simulation is comparable to the aligned-spin case. This implies that the orbital phase evolution will remain an important limitation for post-Newtonian waveforms even in the precessing case.
- When comparing PN theory to NR results, it is important to ensure that the initial conditions used in both cases represent the same physical situation.
